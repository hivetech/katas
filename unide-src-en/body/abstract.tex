\section*{Abstract}

\textbf{We call Unide} an arsenal for developers. This is the very large yet
short definition we found to describe something quite complex today. In the
following pages we are going to explain what really is the unide platform, how
it works and how it could benefit for you.
\newline

Unide is a collaborative workplace for developers combinig smart and innovative
tools. It was put together by HiveTech to help teams build complex softwares
more efficiently.
\newline

This guidebook is intended to be read primarily for developers and contributors
of the project, however it should provide just as much insight for users of
Unide. Since Unide is designed to be understandable and "hackable" by its
users, and as much as possible built with itself, we treat users (both
operators and developers) and contributors as equal citizens.
