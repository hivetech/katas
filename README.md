Here is the dojo where rests my papers. What I learnt and learn about well done
hacking, entrepreneurship adventure, ideas, ...  Open-source is pretty much
raising me with concepts and works so ingenious that worth to tell about and
remenber. 

So smart actually that I built a startup, HiveTech, where we are gathering
those amazing projects and experience to prepare for the community a powerful,
collaborative workspace. This is project Unide.
